<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a passionate and dedicated engineering student currently pursuing my B.Tech at Heritage Institute of Technology. 
  With a strong foundation in core programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and MySQL, I am constantly driven by a desire to learn, solve problems, and build real-world applications. 
  My goal is to become a proficient software engineer and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to excel in the tech industry.

<p>
  Apart from academics, I have actively contributed as a subject matter expert on Chegg, solving over 100+ advanced mathematics problems. 
  This role has strengthened my analytical thinking and precision in problem-solving.
   I also take a keen interest in developing both technical and soft skills, balancing my time between coding practice, academic projects, and continuous learning.
</p>
<p>
  In every project I undertake, I focus on writing clean, efficient code and understanding the underlying logic thoroughly. 
  I believe in consistency, collaboration, and continuous improvement. 
  As I grow in this field, I aim to contribute meaningfully to impactful tech solutions while always staying curious and motivated to explore more.
